I think there's value in seeing shifts in [[https://github.com/JuliaCI/Nanosoldier.jl][nanosoldier]] [[https://github.com/JuliaCI/NanosoldierReports][results]] over time, and an
interactive =GLMakie= plot seems like a good way to do this to me ðŸ™‚.

* Usage

1. Instantiate the project
2. Load =plot.jl=
3. Run ~nanofig()~
4. Profit ðŸ’°
